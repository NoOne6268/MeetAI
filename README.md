# MeetAI

MeetAI is a SaaS AI platform that allows users to create **custom agents with personalized context** and then host **live meetings** with them. After the meeting, users can continue the conversation using AI chat.

Powered by **OpenAI**, **Stream Video**, and **Stream Chat**, MeetAI provides a seamless meeting and post-meeting experience with AI-driven agents.

It includes **paid subscription plans** via [polar.sh](https://polar.sh), **authentication and payment integration** with [better-auth](https://better-auth), and a modern, scalable backend powered by **drizzle-orm** with **Neon Database**.
